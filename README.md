# silverduino

This project is an Arduino-based controller for the Silver Reed SK-840 knitting machine, that is able (or will be able) to perform everything that discontinued PE-1 was able to do.

In particular:
  * have a built-in set of patterns
  * ability to upload patterns from ayab into EEPROM
  * ability to knit from ayab without storing the pattern in the EEPROM (for bigger patterns)
  * ability to set given number of repetitions of the pattern horizontally and vertically
  * pattern strech horizontally or vertically
  * pattern color inversion, mirror and other modifications
  * no need to have a computer around

Everything open-sourced so you can build it by yourself :D
